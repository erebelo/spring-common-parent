# Spring Common Parent

This project serves as a parent POM for managing Spring Boot applications, centralizing the Spring Boot version and shared configurations across multiple modules.

## Features

- **Spring Boot Version Management**: Centralizes the version of Spring Boot used across all child modules to ensure consistency and simplify updates.
- **Common Plugin Configurations**: Provides a common setup for Maven plugins, including:
  - **Spotless Code Formatter**: Enforces code formatting rules using the Spotless plugin, ensuring code quality and consistency across the project.

## Requirements

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.4.1
- Apache Maven 3.8.6

## How to Use

1. **Inherit from the Parent POM**: In your child modules, configure the parent and repositories as follows in the `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <parent>
       <groupId>com.erebelo</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-common-parent</artifactId>
       <version>1.0.0</version>
   </parent>
   ```

   ```xml
     <repositories>
       <repository>
         <id>github</id>
         <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/erebelo/spring-common-parent</url>
       </repository>
     </repositories>
   ```

   **NOTE**: Make sure to update the version of the parent POM as needed based on the projectâ€™s versioning.

2. **Add Dependencies**: Add your specific dependencies to the child module's `pom.xml` as needed.

3. **Build Your Project**: When you build your project, the Spotless plugin will automatically format your code according to the specified rules.

## Run App

Use the following command to build and format the project:

```sh
mvn clean install
```
